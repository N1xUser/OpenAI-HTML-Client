# OpenAI-HTML-Client
This is a simple, local-only interface for interacting with the OpenAI API. It's a single HTML file that you can run directly in your web browser, I made it becouse at the uni they gave me a key to interact with the OpenAI API but sometimes I just want to use the ChatGPT Premium capabilities in a simple web-interface. Feel free to contribute.
